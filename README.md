# Video Processing Project

## Overview

This project is a video processing pipeline designed to analyze a video and detect key features such as edges, lines, and corners. The processed video is then saved as an output file. The main steps involve frame extraction, sharpness detection, edge detection using the Canny algorithm, line detection using the Hough Transform, and corner detection using the Harris Corner Detector.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Google Colab
- OpenCV
- NumPy

### Mount Google Drive

The video file to be processed should be stored in Google Drive. Mount the drive in your Colab environment
